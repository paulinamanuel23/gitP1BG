Falling Ball Game Paulina Manuel

This project involves the creation of a 2D simulation where a spherical object, referred to as the "ball," exhibits horizontal movement within a dynamic environment. The central components of this simulation include the ball, platforms, a designated target area known as the "hole," and a gravitational force effect. Platforms are arranged vertically with a fixed spacing of 100 pixels, and they move upward continuously, with the ball subject to a gravitational pull unless resting on a platform.

Inspiration was from the game Helix Jump played on your mobile phone.
